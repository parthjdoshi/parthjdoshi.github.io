My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning. One of the areas that fascinates me the most is the use of unsupervised and self-supervised learning to alleviate the need for large-scale annotation of training data.

Application of Deep Learning in Facial Recognition
======
* August 2021
* Chapter published in [Design of Intelligent Applications using ML/DL](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=VHM3EAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA195&dq=info:OfWLggYxkcEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=lUkJxXLmyw&sig=QbvZ9YNZeeu6vJeS6vVnm97k_is)
* An analysis of the modern deep learning models used for the task of face recognition and their strengths/drawbacks

Image Modification using Text with GANs
=======
* Undergraduate research project from August 2019 - May 2020
* The paper can be found [here](https://ijcat.com/archieve/volume9/issue11/ijcatr09111001) and the code with demos can be found [here](https://github.com/fenil25/Image-modification-with-text-using-GANs)
* Studied strengths of over 3 approaches for manipulation of image features through natural language descriptions
* Implemented a novel method to change image features such as object colour and shape
* Leveraged PyTorch to train a GAN model on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset to change features of bird images
* Extended the technique for virtual trial of clothes by using the DeepFashion dataset
