I am in my first year in the Master of Science program in the CSE Department at the University of California San Diego. Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering at the University of Mumbai. I have completed multiple internships at [Clutterbot Inc](https://www.clutterbot.com/) and [Desynova Digital](https://www.desynova.com/).

As a young software developer, I am interested in both sides of the equation when it comes to machine learning - grasping the theoretical background of a model and its applications as part of a larger software code-base.
